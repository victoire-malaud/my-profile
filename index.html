                    I am a first year student at ESSEC Business School Asia-Pacific, and currently learning how to code. It is very exciting! 3 things about myself: I am French, I love travelling and I am passionate about horse-riding ;) In fact, my dream project is to be part of the ESSEC Cavaliers Association at ESSEC, which is why I have created its fictional landing-page.

                    I am passionate about <strong>travelling</strong> and <strong>horse-riding</strong>. But also partying with my friends of course!

                <h2>Skills</h2>
                <p>
                    I am <strong>quadrilingual</strong>: I can speak French, English, Spanish and Italian.
                    I know how to use iMovie, and I am quite gifted at video editing.

               <h2>Experiences Abroad</h2>
                <p>
                    I have lived in many different countries: Spain, Mexico, Italy, France and Singapore.
                    I have travelled a lot with my family in Europe and America mostly.
                    But I also travelled on my own to Spain and United Kingdom for horse-riding summer camps.
                    At 17 years-old, I left my family in Paris to go study in Singapore at ESSEC Business School (bold move, I know)
